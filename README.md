<h3 align="center">VirtualizedFX</h3>
VirtualizedFX is yet another attempt at creating an efficient and flexible virtual flow for JavaFX. For those who don't
know what a VirtualFlow is I suggest you reading these articles which also helped me a lot in the realuzation of
VirtualizedFX:
<a href="https://medium.com/ingeniouslysimple/building-a-virtualized-list-from-scratch-9225e8bec120">[1]</a>,
<a href="https://dev.to/murilovarela/make-your-virtualized-list-5cpm">[2]</a>,
<a href="https://dev.to/nishanbajracharya/what-i-learned-from-building-my-own-virtualized-list-library-for-react-45ik">[3]</a>,
<a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/virtualized-rendering-from-scratch-in-react-34c2ad482b16">[4]</a>.
<p></p>

Unlike other VirtualFlows, VirtualizedFX's code is well documented, well organized and fairly simple which not only
makes the project easier to maintain but also easier to understand, also it <b>doesn't</b> depend on any third party
library/software.

As of now VirtualizedFX offers only a basic Virtual Flow to implement ListViews, TableViews and maybe also TreeViews.
The cells must have fixes sizes depending on the orientation (fixed width for horizontal flows, and fixed height for
vertical flows) and this is the most efficient form of Virtual Flow. In the future I would also like to implement more
complex Virtual Flows, one that doesn't care about cells sizes, one specifically for TreeViews and who knows what else.

<h3 align="center">SimpleVirtualFlow</h3>
SimpleVirtualFlow is the basic implementation of a Virtual Flow offered by VirtualizedFX. Without talking about that
blob/spaghetti coding that is the JavaFX VirtualFlow, let's compare it to Flowless.

- The base idea of cells is the same. For VirtualizedFX Cells are just dumb controls they do not have any logic and they
  aren't even nodes. This makes the Virtual Flow extremely flexible and efficient.
- Cells are always reused, this makes the code easier, and the Virtual Flow more efficient as creating new Nodes is way
  more heavy on performance rather than updating them, consider that the user can scroll at very fast speeds, and
  creating new cells at those speeds is a no go for a component that has efficiency as a top priority.
- There are empty cells, or to be more precise, they are hidden if they are not needed. This allows to do some cool
  tricks with the Virtual Flow, for example you could create paginated lists or tables. In such cases for example the
  last page may not have enough items to fill the viewport so the unneeded cells are hidden.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

In this section you can learn what do you need to use my library in your projects.

### Build

To build VirtualizeFX, execute the following command:

    gradlew build

**NOTE** : VirtualizedFX requires **Java 11** and above.

### Usage

###### Gradle

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  implementation 'io.github.palexdev:virtualizedfx:11.2.5'
}
```

###### Maven

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.palexdev</groupId>
    <artifactId>virtualizedfx</artifactId>
    <version>11.2.5</version>
</dependency>
```

<!-- DONATION -->

#### Donation

Implementing a new Virtual Flow from scratch has been a really hard task, such a low level component. But the
satisfaction in having today something so complex that works so good is immense. If you are using VirtualizedFX in your
projects and feel like it, you can make a small donation here:
[![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/$-support-green.svg?style=flat-square)](https://bit.ly/31XB8zD), it would really
make my day.
